# Authenticating Web Apps

How Web Apps Could Communicate with Server Securely


## Login Approaches

One place to look on many strategies is Passport module.


### Local Login

* Local Strategy where the app itself is responsible for account creation


### Third Party Login

* The login is delagated to third party service usually social applications like Twitter, Facebook, and Google

### Mozilla Persona

> seems to me like social login but using email providers instead of social app providers so still kind of third party login


#### Pros and Cons for TPL

Both of these make some strong points on cluttered screen, branding, security delegated 
to someone else which might be compromised at some point in time. Very interesting discussion in general.
