# Security Mechanisms

From https://stormpath.com/blog/secure-your-rest-api-right-way

Last year, the lead author and editor of the OAuth2 standard resigned, with this informative post.. 
Because of this instability in the spec committee and because OAuth2’s default settings are less 
secure than OAuth1 (no digital signature means you can’t verify if contents have been tampered with before or after transit), 
we recommend OAuth1 over OAuth2 for sensitive data applications.  OAuth2 could make sense for less sensitive environments, 
like some social networks.
