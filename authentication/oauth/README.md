# oAuth In Brief

>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
>application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
>behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
>between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the
>third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This
>specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described
>in RFC 5849.`
> -- <cite>Specification: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749</cite>

# Types

There are many different scenarious in which oAuth is used.

## Web Flow
 
* An application redirects users to SERVICE to log in. 

* SERVICE then presents a dialog indicating the name of the app as well as the level of access the app has once itâ€™s authorized by the user. 

* After a user authorizes access, the SERVICE redirects the user back to the application.
