Apex and Serverless are specifically working on Amazon Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.

While other solutions like zeit now are agnostic to the infrastructure.

* The Future is Serverless

> In the pre-cloud days, developers who wanted to build an application needed to think a lot about servers. 

> The cloud has simply removed a significant chunk of work around managing and provisioning servers.

> The concept of an “application” in the cloud is quickly evolving. 

> The monolithic application is giving way to a distributed system spread across a number of applications, processes and data stores. 

> It’s no longer about building a “Web app.” It’s about building a distributed system of loosely coupled components in the cloud.

> Going serverless lets developers shift their focus from the server level to the task level. 

> Serverless solutions let developers focus on what their application or system needs to do by taking away the complexity of the backend infrastructure.

* Nice discussion on Serverless vs. Microservices

> serverless is something related to running backends directly on AWS and since these are lambda function 
> each of this functions could be considered microservice....however we still have servers somewhere 
> ("serverless" means lots of other peoples' servers)....some people confuse BaaS with serverless which is even more incorrect
