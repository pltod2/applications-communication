WHAT IS THE BEST GRANULARITY OF THE EXPOSED APIs? 

APIs 
 
* APIs are too generic and not appropriate for all clients at once 

* The creation of the rules given to developers who consume the API rather than forcing them to adhere to a generic set of rules applied by the API team.

* There are different patterns to mitigate this inapropriaty - e.g. Backends for frontends
