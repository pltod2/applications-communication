On a high level, both Falcor and GraphQL were designed to solve the same problem — managing the increasingly complex data requirements of modern web/mobile apps.
Interesting fact: You could implement all of Falcor in GraphQL (but not the other way round). 
In fact, Huey Peterson has already done something similar here http://hueypetersen.com/posts/2015/10/26/querying-graphql-with-falcor/
