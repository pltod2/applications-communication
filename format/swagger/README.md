## Swagger Standard (Now Open API)

* https://openapis.org/

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is

> To define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers

> To discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection

> When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

> Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swager removes the guesswork in calling the service.
