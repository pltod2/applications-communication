This is all about spreading the work among many systems and controling this flow.

The difference with control flow patterns is that:

* control flow patterns - focus on the flow control of single app 

* synchronization - focus on synchronizing (flow control) the work of many apps

The difference with orchestration is that:

* orchestration focuses on data massaging

* synchronisation focuses on process management and control flow
