# APPLICATIONS COMMUNICATIONS

**The Art of How Apps Talk Each Other - An Opinionated Abstraction**

# ASPECTS

A place where to learn how the applications communicate:

* how they describe data - standards like Swagger / GraphQL etc.

* how they secure data  - standards like oAuth / JWT etc.

* how to design programming interfaces - developer point of view

* low level details - communication and network protocols  

* how things are implemented in Node.js

Considering that communication requires some sort of governance (gateway) the technical aspects are:

* Proxy support

* Authentication/Authorization

* SSL/TLS termination

* Encryption

* Logging

* Load balancing

* Routing

* Throttling

* Lightweight orchestration
